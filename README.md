# Running the code
To get a copy of the code, you can either clone this repository or download as a zip-file
[here](https://github.com/NiclRich/NumPrak/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

To run the code, enter in your terminal the following commands:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This executes the Julia code for the Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation and opens the documentation.
